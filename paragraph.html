    <h1>ABOUT HTML:</h1>
    <P> HTML documents are basically a tree of nodes, including HTML elements and text nodes. HTML elements provide the
        semantics and formatting for documents, including creating paragraphs, lists and tables, and embedding images
        and form controls. Each element may have multiple attributes specified.
    </P>
    <P>The HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text
        separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any
        structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.
    </P>
